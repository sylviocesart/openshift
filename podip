The simplest answer is to ensure that your pod or replication controller yaml/json files add the pod IP as an environment variable by adding the config block defined below. (the block below additionally makes the name and namespace available to the pod)

    env:
    - name: MY_POD_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.name
    - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
    - name: MY_POD_IP
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: status.podIP
Recreate the pod/rc and then try

echo $MY_POD_IP
